Welcome to my first blog post on GitHub Pages!
I created this site to document my learning journey — especially in data science, coding, and the random projects I build along the way.

Over the past few months, I’ve been exploring everything from Python and probability to building Telegram bots and creating dashboards. I realised that writing things down not only helps me understand them better, but also creates a record I can look back on later.

In this blog, I’ll be sharing:

Short reflections on what I’m learning

Tips and explanations for concepts that confused me at first

Small projects or experiments I’m working on

Anything cool I discover as I grow in data and tech

It doesn’t have to be perfect — it just has to be mine.
Thanks for stopping by, and feel free to follow along as the journey continues! 🚀
